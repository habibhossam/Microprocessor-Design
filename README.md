8-bit microcontrollers, as the name suggests, are designed with an 8-bit data bus, allowing them to process data in 8-bit chunks. 
This means they can handle operations on numbers ranging from 0 to 255 or perform bitwise operations on 8-bit data sets. 
Despite their relatively limited data width compared to higher-bit microcontrollers, 8-bit microcontrollers have become a popular choice for numerous embedded system applications. 
Their cost-effectiveness, simplicity, and energy efficiency make them well-suited for tasks with modest computational requirements.
The SAP-1 architecture can be visualized through its block diagram, which showcases the key components responsible for its operation. At its core, SAP-1 consists of a central processing unit (CPU) coupled with memory and input/output interfaces. 

   The CPU comprises several major components, including the accumulator, arithmetic and logic unit (ALU), control unit, registers, program counter, and memory address register. These components work in harmony to execute instructions and perform computations.
