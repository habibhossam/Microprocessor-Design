@W: MT529 :"c:\users\cnd\desktop\new_sap\t_state_counter.v":6:4:6:9|Found inferred clock main|buf_clk_1_inferred_clock which controls 45 sequential elements including uut.seq.counter.T_1[4:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
